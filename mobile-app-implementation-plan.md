# Mobile App Implementation Plan

## Overview
We will create a native mobile application using React Native that will connect to our existing backend API. This will allow us to maintain our current web application while adding mobile support for Android and iOS platforms.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Setup
- Create a new React Native project using Expo or React Native CLI in a separate directory
- Set up the development environment for Android/iOS
- Configure project structure similar to our web app for consistency

### 2. Authentication
- Implement Login/Register screens using the same API endpoints as our web app
- Use secure storage for auth tokens on mobile devices
- Configure session management for mobile

### 3. Core Features Implementation
Each of the following sections will need to be implemented as mobile screens with appropriate UI components:

#### Dashboard
- User profile display
- Plant status cards 
- Recent activity list
- Quick action buttons

#### Plants Management
- Plant list with filtering/sorting
- Plant details view
- Add/edit plant functionality
- Plant care actions (water, fertilize, etc.)

#### Calendar
- Calendar view for scheduled plant care
- Task completion tracking
- Date navigation

#### Tasks
- Task list with filtering
- Task completion functionality
- Task creation/editing

#### Plant Scanner
- Camera integration for plant photos
- Integration with Anthropic Claude API 
- Results display and saving

#### Voice Assistant
- Voice input integration
- Claude API integration for responses
- Voice output for assistant responses

#### Hardware Monitoring
- Real-time sensor data display
- WebSocket connection to ESP8266
- Control interface for watering system

### 4. Mobile-Specific Features
- Push notifications for care reminders
- Offline capability for basic functionality
- Camera integration for plant photos
- Location services for plant environment data
- Barcode/QR scanning for plant identification

### 5. Integration with Backend
- Connect to existing API endpoints
- Implement proper error handling for mobile connectivity
- Add any mobile-specific endpoints needed

### 6. Styling and User Experience
- Create consistent styling with our web app
- Optimize UI for touch interaction
- Implement gesture-based navigation
- Ensure accessibility features

### 7. Testing and Deployment
- Test on Android and iOS simulators
- Fix platform-specific issues
- Prepare for app store submission

## Technology Stack
- React Native for cross-platform development
- React Navigation for navigation
- AsyncStorage for local data
- Axios for API requests
- React Native Camera for scanner functionality
- React Native Voice for voice assistant
- WebSocket integration for hardware monitoring

## Timeline Estimate
- Initial setup and core navigation: 1-2 weeks
- Authentication and basic screens: 2-3 weeks
- Feature implementation: 4-6 weeks
- Testing and refinement: 2-3 weeks
- App store preparation: 1 week

## Code Sharing Strategy
- Share types/interfaces between web and mobile
- Maintain consistent API contract
- Extract common business logic into shared utilities when possible
- Maintain similar folder structure for easier maintenance

## Deployment Strategy
- Android: Google Play Store
- iOS: Apple App Store
- Consider TestFlight/internal testing channels for early feedback

## Getting Started
To begin implementation, we should:
1. Set up a new repository or directory for the mobile app
2. Configure the development environment
3. Start with authentication and core navigation
4. Implement features in priority order
